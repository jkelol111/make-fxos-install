# Make FxOS Install

Command-line tools to install packaged and hosted apps using the Firefox OS remote debugging protocols.

## How it works

1. `Makefile`: *(Packaged app only)* Package all files from folder into `application.zip`
2. `Makefile`: Move important files to phone via `adb`
3. `Makefile`: Forward remote debugging port (6000) from device to computer (via `adb`)
4. `Makefile`: Run `install.js` via `xpcshell`
5. `install.js`: Remotely install app from folder using the [Webapp Actor](http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/b2g/chrome/content/dbg-webapps-actors.js).

The script infers the app id, which is required for the install script, from the last folder in the app path. Optionally it can be provided in the command line via `ID=`. The id should to be lower case.

## Dependencies

Extract the following packages `~/bin`.

If you choose a different path, change the variables in `Makefile`):

	XPCSHELL = ~/bin/xulrunner-sdk/bin/xpcshell
	ADB = ~/bin/android-sdk/platform-tools/adb

### XULRunner (contains XPCShell command)

### Android SDK (contains ADB command)

### Enable `Remote Debugging` on Device

Enable `Remote Debugging` in `Settings > Device Information > Developer`.

## Usage

### Packaged

See folder `my-package`. Your app should at least have an `index.html` and a `manifest.webapp` with the correct `launch_path`. App `type` can be either `web` or `privileged`.

Install packaged app from folder ``

	make FOLDER=my-package packaged install

From another folder:

	make FOLDER=~/Sites/mobile-dev packaged install

From another folder, setting app id (recommended if the folder name is not useful as unique app id):

	make FOLDER=~/Sites/mobile-dev/web ID=mobile-dev packaged install

### Hosted

See `my-hosted` folder. Your folder only needs to contain `manifest.webapp` and a `metadata.json`. In most cases you only need to adapt `origin` in `metadata.json` and `launch_path` in the manifest.

Install hosted app from folder `my-hosted`:

	make FOLDER=my-hosted hosted install

To [Fabrice](https://github.com/fabricedesre) for `install.js`, its remote debugging counterpart and for always fixing broken things.
